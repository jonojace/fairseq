This study has the same tasks as those approved by the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics Research Ethics procedure, RT number 2971. Please take time to read the following information carefully.
Nature of the study:We are investigating ways of generating synthetic speech that can pronounce words correctly. You are invited to listen to utterances and choose which recordings pronounce the word more correctly. To take the test, you will need a desktop computer, phone, or tablet and a pair of good headphones/earbuds to listen to the stereo signals. Your session will last about 10-15 minutes. You will be given full instructions after consenting to the following conditions.
Compensation:You will be paid at the rate of £7.50/hour to participate in this study. Tasks take 10-15 minutes. We also pay a separate fee to the service we use to recruit participants, Prolific Academic.
Risks and benefits:There are no known risks to participation in this study. By participating, you are contributing to scientific knowledge.
Confidentiality:• We offer our test to a specific audience based on Prolific's screening options (e.g., first language, age range, education level, etc.). This generic information is not related to your name or anything that can identify you, as The Prolific Academic participant recruitment service does not share your personal information with us.• The Qualtrics experiment platform collects and stores your questionnaire responses and your IP address.• The data to which we have access is not associated with your name or with any other personal details that might identify you. Your questionnaire responses will only be available to the researcher(s) named above and their research group within the University of Edinburgh. This data will be stored on the School of Informatics' secure file servers. Although every reasonable effort has been taken, confidentiality during internet communication procedures cannot beguaranteed.
